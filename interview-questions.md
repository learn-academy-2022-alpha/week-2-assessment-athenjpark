# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

  Your answer: A parameter is the broader term that refers to what types of data a function can take in if the function requires any. An argument is the specific value that is passed as the parameter for a given function.

  Researched answer: A parameter is a placeholder variable that can be named anything but for the sake of efficiency, the parameter should be named something descriptive and related to the function. The parameter will always be within the parentheses of the function expression. An argument, however, is the actual value of what is passed to the function within the function invocation.



2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

  Your answer: The .map() method takes in three parameters: value, index, and array. The only required parameter for the .map() method is value. Index and array are the optional parameters.

  Researched answer: Value, index, and array are the predefined parameters for the built-in JavaScript method .map(). Value is the only required parameter when utilizing the .map() but can also take the index and/or the array parameter if necessary. If there is an instance where all three parameters need to be utilized, the order must stay the same. The order of the parameters will always be value, index, array.



3. What is the difference between map and filter?

  Your answer: The .map() is a higher order function that will take in an array, iterate through the array, and return an array that is the same length as the original array. However, the .filter() is a higher order function that will take in an array, iterate through the array, and return an array that is not the same length as the original array.

  Researched answer: Like stated in my answer, the .map() will take in and iterate through an array and ultimately return an array that is of the same length as the original array but with different values. The .filter() is a higher order function that will take in and iterate through an array but only return a subset of the original array based on certain conditions/criteria.



4. What is the difference between a function and a method?

  Your answer: A function is a reusable and an executable block of code that can be called on through a function invocation. Methods are very often utilized within functions so that the function can perform specific tasks or actions. The method itself is a line of code that is responsible for mutating or accessing data types.

  Researched answer: Functions and methods in JavaScript are very similar. The biggest difference between the two is that methods are essentially functions that are associated with an object.



5. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer: Object destructuring is just an alternate way to assign variables in JavaScript. Utilizing this is particularly useful when it comes to objects since they have multiple properties that can be assigned to different variables.

  Researched answer: Object destructuring is the act of extracting data from arrays or objects and assigning them distinct variables.



6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

  Your answer: This is my first time ever hearing this term in JavaScript so I am going to take a wild guess and say that hoisting is the act of moving a variable up (?). Similar to the literal definition of hoisting.

  Researched answer: Hoisting in JavaScript refers to the process of declaring functions, variables, and classes and moving them to the top of the code, before the actual execution of the code. Hoisting can be useful for declaring functions before writing the actual code for that particular function. However, hoisting is not recommended for variables or classes due to unexpected errors that can occur.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Class Inheritance: When classes are able to inherit information from other existing classes to prevent code from being repetitive.

2. React: A JavaScript library for creating user interaces.

3. React state: In a React class component, the data is managed in a special object called state.

4. React lifecycle methods: Lifecycle methods are special methods built into React, used to operate on components throughout their duration in the DOM.

5. DOM: a package that provides DOM specific methods that can be used at the top level of a web app to enable an efficient way of managing DOM elements of the web page.
